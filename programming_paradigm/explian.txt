Class Definition:

Define a class named BankAccount.
Use the __init__ method to initialize an account_balance attribute. Optionally, accept an initial balance parameter, defaulting to zero.
Encapsulation and Behaviors:

Implement deposit(amount), withdraw(amount), and display_balance() methods.
deposit should add the specified amount to account_balance.
withdraw should deduct the amount from account_balance if funds are sufficient, returning True; otherwise, return False and do not alter the balance.
display_balance should print the current balance in a user-friendly format.
